Code and raw data for the paper "Dissecting a biological electron transport network with electrochemistry"

.m scripts should be run in Matlab. Provided scripts will process raw data files contained within the same directory, outputting the figures found in the manuscript. Run scripts on with a monitor with 4k resolution to ensure proper scaling of figure elements.  

Any code file can be edited to take other inputs just by changing the annotated pre-initialisation conditions in the first section of the .m file. Any code with "Baseliner" in the title is used to do the curve fitting operations specified in the methods section of the paper.
